## Reflection 
- For me I really struggled with this assignment. It was hard for me to understand the docuementation and I could not get my routes to and from the api and the database to work and so i ended up restarting last night around 7pm and was not able to get much accomplished at that point because I was so frustrated. Throughout the next couple of days I want to take the time to get this assignment working and really understand the way everything fits together. I think for me I try to do too many things at once and that is causing me lots of issues because I write a lot of code and don't test each part so I run into errors and have no idea which part of my code caused the error. Going forward I am going to do a lot more planning and thinking about an assignment before I even think about writing code and also taking it step by step and testing my code as I go along.
